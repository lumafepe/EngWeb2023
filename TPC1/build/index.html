                <p class="text-s">Iguanas are very large lizards that can live 20 or more years in captivity and can grow as long as six feet, nose to tail tip.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Iguanas like to have a basking zone that is around 90 degrees Fahrenheit and should have a cooler zone that doesnâ€™t fall below the mid-70s.</p>
                <p class="text-s">As they grow, iguanas will shed their skin and will continue to do so throughout life, with young animals shedding several times each year and older ones shedding sometimes only once a year.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Iguanas are herbivores, eating predominantly vegetables and fruit in the wild with an occasional insect, snail or birdâ€™s egg.</p>
                <p class="text-s">In the wild, iguanas can break off their tails to escape if a predator grabs the tail and holds on.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Not only do iguanas have great vision and see colors, as well as UV light, sharply, but they also have an unusual photosensory organ on top of their heads called the pineal gland, or parietal eye.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Although they donâ€™t actually use verbal language to communicate, iguanas talk to each other through head bobbing and through movement of the flap of skin under their necks â€” called a dewlap.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Many people unfamiliar with iguanas donâ€™t realize it, but pet iguanas absolutely recognize their owners by sight and sound.</p>

                <span class="text-2xl font-bold text-white">Anatomy and physiology</span>
                <p class="text-s">Iguanas are large lizards that can range from 1.2 to 2.0 m (4 to 6.5 ft) in length, including their tails. They possess a dewlap and a row of elongated scales running from the midline of their necks down to their tails. Iguanas have varying types of scales covering different areas of their body, for example, some large, round tuberculate scales are scattered around the lateral region of the neck among smaller, overlapping scales. The scales on the dorsal trunk of their bodies are also thicker and more tightly packed than those on the ventral sides. These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large, round scale on their cheeks known as a subtympanic shield.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Iguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species. </p>
                <p class="text-s">The tympanum, the iguana's eardrum, is located above the subtympanic shield (or "ear shield") behind each eye. </p>
                <p class="text-s">Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings, and their coloration enables them to hide from larger predators.</p>
                <p class="text-s">Like most reptiles, an iguana has a three-chambered heart with two atria, one ventricle, and two aortae with a systemic circulation. The muscles of an iguana are very light in color due to the high proportion of fast-twitch, glycolytic muscle fibers (type A). These A fibers are not very vascularized and are low in myoglobin, giving them their pale look. This high density of A fibers allows iguanas to move very quickly for a short period of time, which facilitates short bursts of movement, but is inefficient for long duration movement, since cellular respiration in A fibers is anaerobic. </p>

                <span class="text-2xl font-bold text-white">Parietal eye</span>
                <p class="text-s">Several species of lizards, including the iguanas, have a pale scale towards the back of their heads marking the parietal eye. This organ is sensitive to changes in illumination and sends signals to the pineal gland noting the change between day and night. A photopigment commonly found in the lamprey, known as parapinopsin, is also found in the iguana, and is sensitive to ultraviolet light and aids in the signaling between day and night.</p>

                <p class="text-s">Male iguanas, like other male examples of Squamata, have two hemipenes. During copulation, one hemipenis is inserted into the female's cloacal vent. A female can store sperm from previous mates for several years to continue to fertilize her eggs in case she finds no male within her territory when she is ready to lay again.</p>
